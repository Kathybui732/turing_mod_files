## Step 3 Questions

  * ***What is your greatest strength and how do you know?***

  My greatest strength is my open mindedness. I am always willing to try new things, attempt things I'm uncomfortable with, and retry things I did not like before. I think that transfers into my strengths in a professional setting because you have to be openminded when working with others. Other people do not necessarily do things the way you will or think the way you do, and you have to be able to be able to adapt to those situations.

   * ***How do you work best?***

   I work best in environments that allow me to be hands on. I like being able to fumble through and to test things out myself to better grasps the concepts. This allows me to make my own mistakes, so that I can learn better how to do things. I am a hands on and intuitive thinker, therefore, I like to just get going and try things out and see what works and then tweak my course of action from there.

   * ***What is your greatest area of improvement?***

   My greatest area of improvement per the Parin test lies in integrity. My words and actions tend to not align with my beliefs and values. I don't thin that I personally have anything that I am very stringent in believing that there is only one right way to do things. Let's say someone stole something. I do believe that stealing is bad and that you should be punished for stealing. But, I also think that everyone has a reason for doing what they do, so yes, it might be wrong, but what if their reason is understandable? However, I do understand that your actions should align with your values because it shows that you are not a hypocrite. You shouldn't do one thing and say another. So, that is an area I want to work on.

   * ***How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?***

   According to the Parin test, my strengths lie in being an imaginative-inspirational thinker, an ace achiever, being self-confident, and being a lover of transcendence. software development is a career heavily dependent on team interactions. By being an imaginative-inspirational thinker, this means that I can take someone's idea and run with it. I can take what they're envisioning and make it tangible while still coming back to them with what I think would make it better or with criticism on where I think something isn't preforming efficiently. I am an ace achiever, which means that if you give me something to do, I am going to the best I can to make whatever it is the best thing you have ever seen. To me there is no such thing as impossible. Therefore, on a team, I can use this strength to keep pushing my team toward working at something even when it is tough. I am self confident in myself, which means I know where my strengths lie and when I can or cannot do something.

   * ***How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?***

    By knowing your strengths and working preferences, you know what you have to offer when working in a group and how you can most efficiently contribute to your work. This way you can leverage your strengths in a way that will benefit everyone. This also allows you to communicate with your peers when you want an opportunity to be involved in an area where your are less comfortable with. You can let them know that this isn't one of your strongest areas, but you want to learn more about it and attempt to try it which allows for more growth.

 Step 4: Read Ta-Nehisi Coates' article, ["Getting Better at Difficult Things"](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/a-quick-note-on-getting-better-at-difficult-things/387133/) and watch Kathy Sierra's keynote from [Fluent Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM)

 Step 5: Please respond to the following questions in a reflection (4-6 sentences):
  * What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?
  * How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
  * What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?
  * How will you prepare yourself to be at your best with your learning process while at Turing?
