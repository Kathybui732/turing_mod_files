## Step 3 Questions

  * ***What is your greatest strength and how do you know?***

    My greatest strength is my open mindedness. I am always willing to try new things, attempt things I'm uncomfortable with, and retry things I did not like before. I think that transfers into my strengths in a professional setting because you have to be openminded when working with others. Other people do not necessarily do things the way you will or think the way you do, and you have to be able to be able to adapt to those situations. Being openminded means being able to accept that there are many different perspectives and many different ways to do things. It allows you to experience and learn new things which is why I see it as a strength.

  * ***How do you work best?***

    I work best in environments that allow me to be hands on. I like being able to fumble through and to test things out myself to better grasps the concepts. This allows me to make my own mistakes, so that I can learn better how to do things. I am a hands on and intuitive thinker, therefore, I like to just get going and try things out and see what works and then tweak my course of action from there.

  * ***What is your greatest area of improvement?***

    My greatest area of improvement per the Parin test lies in integrity. My words and actions tend to not align with my beliefs and values. I don't thin that I personally have anything that I am very stringent in believing that there is only one right way to do things. Let's say someone stole something. I do believe that stealing is bad and that you should be punished for stealing. But, I also think that everyone has a reason for doing what they do, so yes, it might be wrong, but what if their reason is understandable? However, I do understand that your actions should align with your values because it shows that you are not a hypocrite. You shouldn't do one thing and say another. So, that is an area I want to work on.

  * ***How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?***

    According to the Parin test, my strengths lie in being an imaginative-inspirational thinker, an ace achiever, being self-confident, and being a lover of transcendence. software development is a career heavily dependent on team interactions. By being an imaginative-inspirational thinker, this means that I can take someone's idea and run with it. I can take what they're envisioning and make it tangible while still coming back to them with what I think would make it better or with criticism on where I think something isn't preforming efficiently. I am an ace achiever, which means that if you give me something to do, I am going to the best I can to make whatever it is the best thing you have ever seen. To me there is no such thing as impossible. Therefore, on a team, I can use this strength to keep pushing my team toward working at something even when it is tough. I am self confident in myself, which means I know where my strengths lie and when I can or cannot do something.

  * ***How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?***

    By knowing your strengths and working preferences, you know what you have to offer when working in a group and how you can most efficiently contribute to your work. This way you can leverage your strengths in a way that will benefit everyone. This also allows you to communicate with your peers when you want an opportunity to be involved in an area where your are less comfortable with. You can let them know that this isn't one of your strongest areas, but you want to learn more about it and attempt to try it which allows for more growth.

## Step 5 Questions

  * ***What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?***

    Stressing about how I'm going to learn everything instead of trying to learn everything inhibited my ability to manage my learning process. After the first day of mod 0, I skimmed through all of the lessons and felt completely overwhelmed thinking to myself that there was no way I would be able to remember all of these things. And yet, here we are, pretty comfortable with the basics of gists and github. Because coding is completely new to me, I've been trying to take things one step at a time and trying to master those steps as I go which has been helping this process go more smoothly.

  * ***How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?***

    I am easily stressed out. I try to not let the little things bother me, but one little thing after the next little thing leads to a cascade of unprecedented stress. And that stress leads to anxiety and that anxiety leads to a lack of productivity and performance. Like Sierra's keynote, you don't notice how much losing the remote takes away from your ability to preform, but it's there and it does. And in Coate's article, sometimes learning something new is really hard and there are always obstacles in the way that at some point makes you want to just give up and claim that it's just impossible for you. But, you have to just remind yourself not to let those little things get in the way of your learning.

  * ***What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?***

    Emotional expressions live in the same part of your brain as problem solving, memory, sexual behavior, language and judgement. All of these higher functions are preformed in one are of the brain. That's why when you're feeling an overwhelming amount of emotions, it's harder for you to focus. It takes over your ability to process information which makes it harder for you to learn. But, just like how emotional can effect your learning, your learning could have the same effect of your emotion. When we get stuck on something, we start to get stressed and getting stressed makes it harder for you to absorb information which then makes even harder to learn. It's an endless cycle. You just have to get up, walk away from everything, take a breath and come back to it with a clearer mind.

  * ***How will you prepare yourself to be at your best with your learning process while at Turing?***

    Limiting distractions and continuously practicing will be what I think will be the best things I can do to aid my learning process at Turing. Limiting distractions such as other obligations (e.g. work), social temptations, and procrastination driven hobbies would be beneficial. Similarly, I am a visual/kinesthetic learner, so I know that in order to master something, I'm going to have to see it in action and play with it so that I can learn the ins and outs of it completely. Because mod 0 ends a ways from when my mod 1 course starts, I signed up for some courses with codeacademy to get a better feel of the material. This way I at least have some background on coding.
