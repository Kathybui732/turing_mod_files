***Why are we talking about empathy at a software development school?***

  Software development is a field in which you have to work with many different people from many different places, from many different backgrounds and from many different circumstances. And because of that we have to be well rehearsed in communication and empathy so that we can better understand one another and not let those factors get in the way of your productivity.

***How can you develop the "skill" of empathy?***

  In order to develop empathy, you must be able to commit yourself emotionally to those around you. You have to put aside your own points of views and try to see other people's points of views. By interacting with people and communicating with them, you will learn how to empathize naturally. With patience, practice and open compassion you can learn empathy. You need to pay attention to other's body language and actively listen to them so that you can not only understand what they're saying, but how. You have to be able to see the meaning behind their actions. Their tone or body language can tell you even more about how they're feeling. Then acknowledge what they're feeling or ask them to elaborate or for them to explain what they think would be a good resolution to the problem. Then take action. That's where it gets more tricky because every situation is different.

***Why should you care?***

  Human beings are social creatures. We need to be able to empathize because it teaches us how to be able to recognize emotions and to share perspectives with other people. Empathy doesn't only apply to negative situations, but positive ones as well. Such as if someone is getting married, by showing genuine joy for their happiness is a form of happiness. Taking the time to learn people's names, being curious about their lives and offering constructive feedback when they need it are all forms of empathy. Being able to empathize shows that you are a reliable person and pleasurable person to be around. By forming that bond with others, you will be able to live more productive lives.

## Reflection Questions

***1. What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?***

  Empathy has played a very important role in my life thus far. I previously worked in the home healthcare field and that requires being able to practice empathy with the geriatric population. There would be days where I would get yelled at for no reason by my clients when I was just trying to help or I would be the scape goat of someone's frustration. But, I would have to put myself in my client's shoes and remember that they're having a hard time, too. With age, they're less able to do certain things that they were used to and that loss of independence would make anyone frustrated. I would have to practice empathy and patience to not let their behavior affect mine and continue to speak to them and do the best I can to provide them with the care they needed.

***3. Why is empathy important for working on a team?***

  When working with other people, it is always important to be empathetic because you don't know what people are experiencing in their life outside of the time they are spending with you. They could be having a hard time, so they could be distracted. Being on a team means that you need to work together and that entails being able to communicate and working with one another to function more effectively. If someone is falling behind or is emotionally distracted, you have to be able to talk to them to see how you guys can work better together so that your project does not suffer. As a team, you have to be able to work together efficiently and make up for one another in order to produce the best code that you can.

***4. Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague***

  One thing I've learned working for the city of Denver is that they are very outdated. But, according to them, if it's not broken, why change it? The people who have worked there have been there for years and have done the same thing the exact same way which is why they feared change. Which is why when the city hired two "young-ins" onto the team, I could feel the initial hostility. At first, I thought why don't they just hire a whole new team altogether because this team was still doing the math physically themselves instead of using excel to speed up their process. After sitting down with one of the guys on my team, I learned that he understands the power of a computer, but it's just a concept he's scared to approach. Sometimes we forget that technology just comes as second nature to us because we've grown up with it and there are people who haven't had that luxury. He taught me how to empathize with his situation and understand why he didn't do things more "efficiently." I tried to help him every time he ran into computer issues and got rid of that negative connotation of old people and technology that I had. I even tried to teach him one computer shortcut a day, so that it wasn't too overwhelming.

***5. or teammate was helpful.***

  Back in college, I got a job as an accounting assistant off of a smile and a go getting positive attitude. And I say this because I had absolutely no prior accounting experience and this was my first job. But, the learning process went smoothly as my some of my teammates were very helpful and patient. They were very detailed in their training and were always happy to help me whenever I got stuck or had any questions. The person I helped with computers ended up helping my with accounting. He has worked in this same position for over the last 30 years. He was very knowledgeable about what he did. He sent me cheat sheets with equations I had to use and for the acronyms I had to use. He would check over my work to make sure all my numbers were right even though he didn't have to. He taught me a lot about accounting and made my first job experience very educational and pleasurable.

***6. When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings?***

  It is always hard to be empathetic when you are the target of misdirected stress or anger. Let's say you have a teammate who is having a hard time at home because they just had a baby. They're tired and grumpy due to the lack of sleep and they end up taking out that stress on you. I find that the hardest situation to be empathetic because in that situation, I did not do anything wrong and yet I keep getting lashed out on. In that situation I would be less inclined to empathize for that person because it seems unfair and the person is being unreasonable.

***7. How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?***

  In those situations, you have to be understanding and be able to communicate on both ends about how you're feeling. On your teammate's side, they can tell you about how they're stressed at home and on your side and maybe you can offer something to help them ease their stress. On your end, you can communicate how their actions are making you feel and maybe they can be more self-aware of their actions toward you. By being able to empathize for one another, you create a stronger team bond and will help you work more efficiently together.
