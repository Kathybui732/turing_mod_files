## Reflection Questions

***1. What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?***

...Empathy has played a very important role in my life thus far. I previously worked in the home healthcare field and that requires being able to practice empathy with the geriatric population. There would be days where I would get yelled at for no reason by my clients when I was just trying to help or I would be the scape goat of someone's frustration. But, I would have to put myself in my client's shoes and remember that they're having a hard time, too. With age, they're less able to do certain things that they were used to and that loss of independence would make anyone frustrated. I would have to practice empathy and patience to not let their behavior affect mine and continue to speak to them and do the best I can to provide them with the care they needed.

***3. Why is empathy important for working on a team?***

...When working with other people, it is always important to be empathetic because you don't know what people are experiencing in their life outside of the time they are spending with you. They could be having a hard time, so they could be distracted. Being on a team means that you need to work together and that entails being able to communicate and working with one another to function more effectively. If someone is falling behind or is emotionally distracted, you have to be able to talk to them to see how you guys can work better together so that your project does not suffer.
